# date_to_day_of_week
This program converts a date greater than the year 1900 and determines the day of the week for that date 

This program will prompt the user for a date (mm/dd/yyyy). The program will then take that date and convert 
the date entered into a very large number representing a particular date. This very large number will be stored 
in a variable of type long integer which will be referred to as N. The program will then take the value stored 
in variable N and determine the number representing the day of the week that the date falls on. That is, if the 
number calculated by the algorithm is zero, then the day is Sunday. If the number calculated is a 1, then the 
day is Monday, etc. The program will ensure that the month entered is between 1 and 12, the day entered is between 
1 and 31, and the year entered is greater than 1900, and that the actual day exists in history taking into account 
leap years.
